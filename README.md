# intro
What do you think of the word electricity ?do you think of light bulbs,or lightning.Well, in this presentation I will talk about static electricity,fossil
fuels,energy sources,energy development,energy circuit,safety and fun facts.So let's get started!

## Static electricity

Static electricity is when tiny electrons are pulled from 1 surface to another.This can happen when you take off a sweater to fast.The difference in electrical
charge can cause a spark  when you touch a metal object.Lightning is a bigger version of static electricity.It happens when masses of air rub against rain clouds. 
Insulators and conductors carry electrons.Insulators don’t let electron through them easily.But conductors are the exact opposite, they let electrons easily.Some
good conductor are copper,silver,aluminum,gold,steel,and brass. Some good insulator are plastic,ceramics,rubber,and wood.That is all about static electricity.

## Fossil fuels

What are fossil fuels?Well if you haven’t already guessed by the name by the name.They are fuels made by the earth from the remains of animals and plants.For
example crude oil is a fossil fuel.We use it to power our cars.But there is a bad side to Crude oil, it is non-reusable,meaning you can’t reuse it. And it releases
greenhouse gas:a substance that affects the temperature making it to hot and is a global threat.Now day,we use wind power and water power because it is better for
planet earth. 

## Energy development

Energy development is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional,
alternative and renewable sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted.
