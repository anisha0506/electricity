# intro
What do you think of the word electricity ?do you think of light bulbs,or lightning.Well, in this presentation I will talk about static electricity,fossil
fuels,energy sources,energy development,energy circuit,safety and fun facts.So let's get started!

## Static electricity

Static electricity is when tiny electrons are pulled from 1 surface to another.This can happen when you take off a sweater to fast.The difference in electrical
charge can cause a spark  when you touch a metal object.Lightning is a bigger version of static electricity.It happens when masses of air rub against rain clouds. 
Insulators and conductors carry electrons.Insulators donâ€™t let electron through them easily.But conductors are the exact opposite, they let electrons easily.Some
good conductor are copper,silver,aluminum,gold,steel,and brass. Some good insulator are plastic,ceramics,rubber,and wood.That is all about static electricity.
