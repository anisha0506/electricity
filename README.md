# Introduction
What do you think of the word electricity? Do you think of light bulbs,or lightning.Well, in this presentation I will talk about static electricity,fossil
fuels,energy sources,energy development,energy circuit,safety and fun facts.So let's get started!

## Static electricity

Static electricity is when tiny electrons are pulled from 1 surface to another.This can happen when you take off a sweater to fast.The difference in electrical
charge can cause a spark  when you touch a metal object.Lightning is a bigger version of static electricity.It happens when masses of air rub against rain clouds. 
Insulators and conductors carry electrons.Insulators don’t let electron through them easily.But conductors are the exact opposite, they let electrons easily.Some
good conductor are copper,silver,aluminum,gold,steel,and brass. Some good insulator are plastic,ceramics,rubber,and wood.That is all about static electricity.

## Fossil fuels

What are fossil fuels?Well if you haven’t already guessed by the name by the name.They are fuels made by the earth from the remains of animals and plants.For
example crude oil is a fossil fuel.We use it to power our cars.But there is a bad side to Crude oil, it is non-reusable,meaning you can’t reuse it. And it releases
greenhouse gas:a substance that affects the temperature making it to hot and is a global threat.Now day,we use wind power and water power because it is better for
planet earth. 

## Energy development

Energy development is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional,
alternative and renewable sources of energy, and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted.

## Energy Circuit

An electric circuit is a complete loop where electricity is flowing to power components in that loop. And electricity is the continuous flow of electrons.Electric
circuits also involve energy transfers. Chemical energy in the battery is changed into electrical potential energy on the two sides of the battery.
To make an electric circuit,you need 3 main parts.You need a source like a battery.Something to pass energy to,like a light bulb.Last,but not least something to
make the loop,like a wire.1 wire carries positive energy,while the other carries negative.That is all about energy circuits.

## Electricity Safety

Electrical hazards can cause burns, shocks and electrocution (death). Assume that all overhead wires are energized at lethal voltages. Never assume that a wire is
safe to touch even if it is down or appears to be insulated. Never touch a fallen overhead power line.

## Fun facts

1. Electricity travels at the speed of light, about 300,000 kilometres per second.

2. A spark of static electricity can measure up to 3,000 volts.

3. The average taser emits 50,000 volts.

4. A bolt of lightning can measure up to three million (3,000,000) volts (and lasts less than one second).
